To install the &Example; package, unpack the archive file, which  should
have a name of form <C>example-<A>XXX</A>.zoo</C> for some version number <A>XXX</A>, by
typing
<P/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<C>unzoo -x example-<A>XXX</A></C>
<P/>
in the <F>pkg</F> directory of your version of &GAP;&nbsp;4,  or  in  a  directory
named <F>pkg</F> (e.g.&nbsp;in your home directory). (The only essential difference
with installing &Example; in a <F>pkg</F> directory different to the &GAP;&nbsp;4
home directory is that one  must  start  &GAP;  with  the  <C>-l</C>  switch,
e.g.&nbsp;if your private <F>pkg</F> directory is a subdirectory of <F>mygap</F> in your
home directory you might type:
<P/>
<!-- TODO: update installation instructions for non-default locations -->
<!-- %begintt -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;<C>gap -l ";<A>myhomedir</A>/mygap"</C>
<!-- %endtt -->
<P/>
where <A>myhomedir</A> is the  path  to  your  home  directory,  which  (since
&GAP;&nbsp;4.3) may be replaced  by  a  tilde.  The  empty  path  before  the
semicolon is  filled  in  by  the  default  path  of  the  &GAP;&nbsp;4  home
directory.)
<P/>
After unpacking the archive, go to the newly created <F>example</F>  directory
and call <C>./configure <A>path</A></C> where <A>path</A> is the path to the &GAP; home
directory. So for example if you install the package in  the  main  <F>pkg</F>
directory call
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
./configure ../..
]]></Log>
<P/>
This will fetch the architecture type for which &GAP; has been  compiled
last and create a <F>Makefile</F>. Now simply call
<P/>
<Log><![CDATA[
make
]]></Log>
<P/>
to compile the binary and to install it in the appropriate place.

<Section Label="Loading the Example Package">
<Heading>Loading the Example Package</Heading>

To use the &Example; Package you have to request it explicitly. This  is
done by calling
<P/>
<Example><![CDATA[
gap> LoadPackage("example");

Loading  Example 3.0
by Werner Nickel (http://www.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~nickel)
   Greg Gamble (http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Greg.Gamble)
For help, type: ?Example package 
----------------------------------------------------------------
true
]]></Example>
<P/>
The <C>LoadPackage</C> command is described  in  
Section&nbsp;<Ref Func="LoadPackage" BookName="ref"/>.
<P/>
If &GAP; cannot find a working binary, the call  to  <C>LoadPackage</C>  will
still succeed but a warning is issued informing that  the  <C>HelloWorld()</C>
function will be unavailable.
<P/>
If you want to load the &Example; package by default, you  can  put  the
<C>LoadPackage</C> command  into  your  <F>.gaprc</F>  file  
(see  Section&nbsp;<Ref Sect="The gap.ini and gaprc files" BookName="ref"/>).
