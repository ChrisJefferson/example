\Chapter{The Example Package}

\atindex{Example package}{@Example package}
This chapter  describes  the  {\GAP}  package  {\Example}.  As  its  name
suggests it is an example of how to  create  a  {\GAP}  package.  It  has
little functionality except for being a package.

If you are viewing this with on-line help, type:
