                             The Example package

This is the README file for the GAP package "Example".

This package serves as an example how to add a package to GAP 4.  This
package uses an external binary  and  therefore  works  only  on  UNIX
systems.

The  package is  distributed with  the main  GAP archive.  For updates
between releases of GAP itself check the package Web page
     http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Greg.Gamble/Example
  
It may  also be  unpacked individually  from the  .zoo (or  .tar.gz or
-win.zip) archive "example-<XXX>.zoo"  (or "example-<XXX>.zoo" or ...)
for some package version <XXX>.

To  complete the  installation of  the ``Example''  package go  to the
directory `example'  created (the  directory contains  a copy  of this
README file) and call

  /bin/sh ./configure <path>

where <path> is a path to the main GAP root directory; so normally you
would call

  /bin/sh ./configure ../..

(the ../.. is the default and can be left out) and then call

  make 
  
to compile the binary.

If you installed GAP on several architectures, you  must  execute  the
configure/make steps for  the  ``Example''  package  on  each  of  the
architectures  immediately  after  configuring  GAP  itself  on   this
architecture.
