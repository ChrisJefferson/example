README file for ``example'' share package.

This share package serves as an example how to add a share package to GAP4.
This share package uses an external binary and therefore works only under
UNIX systems.

To install this share package (after extracting the share packages archive
file to the GAP home directory) go to the directory `pkg/example' (the
directory containing this README file) and call

/bin/sh ./configure path

where path is a path to the main GAP root directory (so normally you would
call /bin/sh ./configure ../..).

afterwards call `make' to compile the binary.

If you installed GAP on several architectures, you must ecexute this
configure/make step for the ``example'' share package on each of the
architectures immediately after configuring GAP itself on this architecture.
