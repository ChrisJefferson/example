                             The Example package

This is the README file for the GAP package ``Example''.

This package serves as an example how to add a package to GAP 4.  This
package uses an external binary and therefore works  only  under  UNIX
systems.

The ``Example'' package is bundled in with the accepted share packages
.zoo  archive:  `acceptedpkg<XXX>.zoo',  for  some  <XXX>.  When  this
archive is unpacked in the `pkg' subdirectory via:

  unzoo -x acceptedpkg<XXX>

a directory `example',  along  with  the  directories  for  the  other
accepted packages in the archive, will have been created.

To complete the installation of the  ``Example''  package  go  to  the
directory `example' created (the directory contains  a  copy  of  this
README file) and call

  /bin/sh ./configure <path>

where <path> is a path to the main GAP root directory; so normally you
would call

  /bin/sh ./configure ../..

and then call

  make 
  
to compile the binary.

If you installed GAP on several architectures, you  must  execute  the
configure/make steps for  the  ``Example''  package  on  each  of  the
architectures  immediately  after  configuring  GAP  itself  on   this
architecture.
